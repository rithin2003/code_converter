Pascal Code Logic:

* `program HelloWorld;`: This line declares the beginning of the program named "HelloWorld".
* `begin`: Starts the execution block of the program.
* `Writeln('Hello, World!');`: This statement prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
* `end.`: Marks the end of the program.

Approach to Convert to Python:

To convert this Pascal code to Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Replace the `program` keyword with `def` to define a function named `HelloWorld`.
2. Replace the `begin` and `end` keywords with indentation to mark the beginning and end of the function block.
3. Convert the `Writeln` statement to `print`. In Pascal, `Writeln` prints a string followed by a newline character. In Python, `print` does the same, but it can be written without the `ln` suffix.

Python Code:


python
def HelloWorld():
    print('Hello, World!')
